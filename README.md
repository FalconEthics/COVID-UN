<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

I have been doing web development for quite a while now and wanted to try React Native as I can use
my web development skills in it. The app provides users with up-to-date information about the
pandemic, including statistics, news, and updates. I believe that this app can be a valuable
resource for people who are trying to stay informed about the pandemic.
(feel free to contribute to the project to help me complete the roadmap):

- [x] Get the frontend and UI/UX ready
- [x] Api integration for world wide covid data
- [x] Complete the MVP
- [ ] Add in-app notifications and user-defined alerts
- [ ] Add social sharing and data visualization features
- [ ] Add educational resources
    - [ ] Helpline integration
    - [ ] Govt. approved backend implementation (proper data)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/FalconEthics/COVID-UN/issuess) for a full list of proposed
features (and known issues).

~Made this app during the lock-down period but the api was way to unstable to be released at that

beta stage!
